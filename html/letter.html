		Abby, the past five months with you have made me happiest man in the world. I would say I am so lucky to have you but it doesn’t seem like luck at all does it? I have known you since I was 6 months old or less, we have so much in common, we connected almost instantly, you are perfect for me, and I love you so much, it’s more of it were meant to be isnt it. I mean just look at us, we are perfect for each other. We make each other so happy right now, and always will. Just think of how happy we are on our now 5 month anniversery, just think of what our 5 years of being together will be like, then our 5 months of marriage, then 5 year anniversary, then imagine our kids 5th year on this world.. I can’t even imagine how cute he/she will be if we are putting your genetics into them. We are going to make the best family together and live out our lives madly in love :). You have made my life so much better, before I met you I was kind of a mess to be honest, always down and depressed, not wanting a future, had no motivations, thought that getting the perfect girl for me was not possible, and I wasn’t bright enough to pursue a career and future I truly wanted. You proved the old me wrong baby. I now have my perfect girl, motivation, a future with you, and a decent career path in mind. My life is amazing and I am just waiting for it to get better, one day we will move in together, one day we will have a child, one day will we get married, and it’s all going to be amazing. While writing this I was looking back at an Instagram post you shared me where the father is crying and kissing his baby after she turns one week old. While I am pretty sure I will not be crying I can’t stop thinking of us cuddled up on a couch with our baby on our lap, looking over at each other with the biggest smiles on our faces, it will be the beginning of an amazing family we will have created. I love you so much, you are my everything Abby. I will always love you. Forever and always.
