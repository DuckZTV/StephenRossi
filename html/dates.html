I was so happy that I was getting to go visit you and even on my first time being there your parents payed for me to get into disney, that has to mean at least something right? Anyways, thinking back to that night if feels like a dream. Holding you in the rain, staring into your beautiful eyes and leaning in to kiss you as the fireworks went off. Again, on the top 5 best nights of my life. (ps. The other four are with you too ‚ù§) </td>

Just the thought of that makes me so happy, and I cant wait till we wake up to the pitter patter of little footsteps running into our bedroom on Christmas morning. I actually really liked that from at least what I saw your family accepted me and did not disapprove enough to point it out while I was there. I cant tell you how much that means to me and omg I really need to write that thank you card shit I forgot... </td>
